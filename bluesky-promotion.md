**Discover how your financial "parts" influence every money decision you make.** SpendSentinel uses Internal Family Systems principles to help you understand and work compassionately with the protective parts that drive your spending, saving, and avoidance patterns. Instead of fighting your financial behaviors, learn to recognize them as firefighters trying to keep you safe—then gently guide them toward healthier choices.
