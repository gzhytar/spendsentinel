# **App Name**: SpendSentinel

## Tagline: "Pause Â· Notice Â· Choose."

## App purpose: Transform Your Relationship with Money Through Compassionate Self-Discovery. Understand the different parts of yourself that influence your financial decisions and learn to work with them, not against them

## App vision: an interactive, AI-powered Financial Therapist and Coach that behaves like a personal financial-behavior specialist, mindfulness mentor, and trauma-informed coach. With the goal of supporting and guiding users on how to achieve both financial health and emotional well-being. 

## Style Guidelines:

> **ðŸŽ¨ Primary Design Reference**: For comprehensive visual design decisions, component patterns, and UX guidelines, refer to [`docs/design-guidelines.md`](./design-guidelines.md). This document serves as the authoritative source for maintaining design consistency across all features and should be consulted by AI/LLM when making any visual or interaction design decisions.

### Core Visual Identity
- Primary color: A calming lavender #B5B7E8, selected to instill a sense of peace and balance, drawing inspiration from mindfulness practices. Its versatility makes it adaptable to various UI components without overwhelming the user.
- Background color: Soft sand #EADDCB (warmth), providing a soft, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain, in keeping with a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Deep teal #0F5850 (vigilant presence), ideal for highlighting interactive elements and CTAs. The brightness and saturation is offset from the primary.
- Clean and easily legible font to ensure the content is easily readable. Radix-UI font choices will be used as a base.
- App icon: minimal eye-within-circle (watchful Self) whose negative space hints at a heartâ€”protection and compassion.

### Design System Foundation
- **Component Structure**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns with consistent Card â†’ CardHeader â†’ CardContent â†’ CardFooter structure
- **Button Hierarchy**: State-driven design with primary (lavender) for main actions, secondary (outline) for supporting actions
- **Layout Principles**: Responsive grid layouts, consistent spacing (`space-y-8`), and mobile-first approach
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Contextual emphasis based on user progress and application state
- Simple and intuitive layouts with ample spacing to reduce clutter and promote a sense of calm. Radix-UI layouts will be used as a base.
- Subtle animations that provide gentle feedback and guide the user through the app. Radix-UI animations will be used as a base.

### AI/LLM Design Decision Framework
When implementing new features or modifying existing ones:
1. **Always consult** [`docs/design-guidelines.md`](./design-guidelines.md) for visual and interaction patterns
2. **Prioritize consistency** with established component structures and color usage
3. **Apply state-driven design** principles for dynamic user experiences
4. **Follow accessibility guidelines** as outlined in the design guide
5. **Maintain responsive design** patterns for all screen sizes

## Tone guidelines:
Use "invite" not "warn", "notice" not "fail", "parts" language sparingly outside psycho-education screens. Example: "A part noticed extra coffee runs ( +â‚¬24 this week ). Breathe, then decide."	

## Feature Specifications

### Feature: Quick Firefighter Assessment

#### Purpose and Impact
- **User Need**: Users need a simple and fast way to get an initial idea of their dominant financial firefighter type.
- **Expected Outcome**: User gains awareness of their primary firefighter type and a brief explanation, encouraging further exploration and self-compassion.
- **Emotional Impact**: Should make the user feel curious, understood, and gently guided, not judged or pigeonholed.

#### Functional Requirements
- **Core Functionality**: Presents a series of (currently 4) multiple-choice questions. Based on answers, identifies one of the predefined firefighter types (Spender, Hoarder, Avoider, Indulger). Displays the result with a description and interpretation guide.
- **User Interactions**: User selects one option per question, navigates (next/previous/start/cancel), submits to see results. Can choose an "I'm not sure / None of these match me" option for questions. Can repeat the quiz.
- **Data Requirements**: Predefined set of questions, options for each question, mapping of answer combinations to firefighter types, descriptions for each firefighter type, result interpretation guide, and text for uncertainty notices.

#### UI/UX Specifications
- **Component Placement**: Prominently on the "Self-Assessment" page (`src/app/[lang]/self-assessment/page.tsx`).
- **Visual Elements**:
    - Introduction screen with title, description, and "Start Assessment" button.
    - Quiz screen with progress indicator (e.g., "Question X of Y"), question text, multiple-choice options (e.g., radio buttons or styled button group), navigation buttons ("Previous", "Next", "Cancel").
    - Results screen displaying: "Your primary firefighter type is: [Type Name]", a description of the type, an interpretation guide, and a "Repeat Quiz" button.
    - An "Uncertainty Notice" if the user selects unsure options, suggesting the Deep Assessment.
- **Interactive Behavior**: Smooth transitions between questions. Clear indication of selected option. Feedback upon completion. Visual progress tracking.
- **States**:
    - Initial/Welcome state.
    - Quiz In-Progress state (one for each question).
    - Results Displayed state.
    - Uncertainty Notice state.

#### Technical Implementation Guidelines
- **Suggested Approach**: Client-side logic for quiz flow, state management (e.g., using React `useState` or `useReducer`), and result calculation based on a predefined algorithm/mapping of answers to types. Content (questions, options, results text) managed via `i18n` translation files.
- **Integration Points**: Links/references to the detailed "Firefighter Types" component/section for users to learn more about their identified type.
- **Performance Considerations**: Should be lightweight and fast, primarily client-side operations during the quiz.

#### Examples
- **Sample Content (from `en.ts`):**
    - Quiz Title: "Quick Firefighter Assessment"
    - Instruction: "Answer 4 quick questions to discover which financial 'firefighter' part is most active in your life."
    - Question: "When you feel stressed about money, what's your first instinct?"
    - Option: "Browse online stores or go shopping"
    - Result Text: "Your primary firefighter type is: The Spender"
    - Result Description: "This doesn't define you completelyâ€”we all have multiple parts. Understanding your dominant pattern is the first step toward financial self-compassion."

### Feature: Deep Assessment (Personalized Financial Part Identification)

#### Purpose and Impact
- **User Need**: Users who are unsure about their type from the quick quiz, or who want a more nuanced and personalized understanding of their financial parts, need a way to explore this with more context.
- **Expected Outcome**: User submits descriptions of their financial situation and behavior, and receives an AI-generated identification of a financial "part" active in their described situation. This includes its role, burden, concern, and a suggested engagement strategy based on IFS principles. This should foster deeper self-understanding and introduce IFS concepts in a practical way.
- **Emotional Impact**: Should make the user feel heard, validated, and empowered with actionable, compassionate insights. The interaction with AI should feel supportive and non-judgmental.

#### Functional Requirements
- **Core Functionality**: Allows users to describe their current financial situation and recent financial behavior/decisions in free-text input fields. Submits this information to an AI model (referred to as "IFS Dialogue" in general app vision). The AI analyzes the input and identifies a relevant financial "part" (potentially a firefighter type or a more nuanced aspect), providing an analysis that may include its role, burden, concern, and suggested ways to engage with this part.
- **User Interactions**: User types into two main text areas ("Describe your current financial situation", "Describe your recent financial behavior"). Clicks an "Identify My Financial Parts" button. Views the AI-generated results. Options to "Start New Assessment" or "Explore This Part Deeper" (which could be a premium feature).
- **Data Requirements**: User's textual input for the two prompts. An AI model trained or prompted for IFS-based analysis of financial narratives. Content for result presentation (titles, labels for role, burden, concern, etc.) from `i18n`.

#### UI/UX Specifications
- **Component Placement**: On the "Self-Assessment" page, possibly presented as an alternative or follow-up to the Quick Firefighter Assessment.
- **Visual Elements**:
    - Section title like "Deep Assessment" or "Personalized Financial Part Identification".
    - Two text input areas with clear labels and placeholders (e.g., "Share what's happening with your finances right now...", "Tell us about your spending, saving, or money-related decisions...").
    - An "Identify My Financial Parts" button.
    - A loading/processing indicator while the AI is working.
    - A results display area showing: "Meet Your {partName}", and sections for "Role", "What it carries (Burden)", "Its biggest worry (Concern)", and "How to work with this part (Suggested Engagement)".
    - Buttons like "Start New Assessment" and "Explore This Part Deeper".
    - A tooltip for the "Explore This Part Deeper" button if it's a premium feature.
- **Interactive Behavior**: Text areas should be resizable or accommodate sufficient text. Clear loading state during AI processing. Results should be presented in an easily digestible format.
- **States**:
    - Initial input form state.
    - Loading/Processing state (after submission, before AI response).
    - Results Displayed state.
    - Error state (e.g., if AI service fails or input is insufficient).

#### Technical Implementation Guidelines
- **Suggested Approach**: Frontend form (React components) captures user input. An API call is made to a backend service that interfaces with the AI model (IFS Dialogue capability). The backend processes the request, gets the AI analysis, and returns it to the frontend.
- **Integration Points**: Secure API endpoint for the AI-driven IFS Dialogue service. User authentication might be needed if results are to be saved or tied to a user account, especially for premium "Explore Deeper" features. Error handling for API calls.
- **Performance Considerations**: Manage user expectations for AI processing time with clear loading indicators and potentially asynchronous feedback if processing is lengthy.

#### Examples
- **Sample Content (from `en.ts` and `blueprint.md`):**
    - Form Title: "Personalized Financial Part Identification"
    - Placeholder 1: "Share what's happening with your finances right now - debts, income, expenses, goals, challenges..."
    - Placeholder 2: "Tell us about your spending, saving, or money-related decisions in the past few weeks or months..."
    - Identify Button: "Identify My Financial Parts"
    - Result Title Example: "Meet Your Protector Part" (or specific firefighter like "The Spender")
    - Result Fields: Role, Burden, Concern, Suggested Engagement (with descriptions).
