# **App Name**: ToBeDefined

## App vision: an interactive, AI-powered Financial Therapist and Coach that behaves like a personal financial-behavior specialist, mindfulness mentor, and trauma-informed coach. With the goal of supporting and guiding users on how to achieve both financial health and emotional well-being. 

## Core Features:

- IFS Dialogue: AI-driven dialogue to identify and understand the user's financial "firefighter" parts using the 6F (Find, Focus, Flesh out, Feel toward, Befriend, Fears) framework, surfacing the role, burden, and concern of each part. This acts as a decision-making tool, and must carefully assess how to communicate sometimes complex emotional concepts to end-users of different personality types, in a supportive manner. This uses a tool to make decisions about how to engage the user.
- Financial GPS: Interactive timeline mapping past influences, present snapshot, and vision board to establish a financial GPS, showing a 'You Are Here' point.
- Expense Highlighter: Expense tool allowing users to highlight expenses as 'Living' vs. 'Lifestyle' to promote mindful spending decisions.
- Panic Button: A 'Red-Dot Panic' feature which offers users the ability to instantly hide sensitive financial screens and trigger a quick grounding exercise if they feel triggered or overwhelmed.
- Self-Compassion Prompts: Daily self-compassion micro-practices integrated into the app's workflow that provides supportive messaging. Tracks self-reported calm scores and the ratio of self-critical statements over time.
